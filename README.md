About Tup
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tup is a file-based build system for Linux, OSX, and Windows. It inputs
a list of file changes and a directed acyclic graph (DAG), then processes
the DAG to execute the appropriate commands required to update dependent
files. Updates are performed with very little overhead since tup implements
powerful build algorithms to avoid doing unnecessary work. This means you
can stay focused on your project rather than on your build system.

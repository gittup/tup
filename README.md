## About Tup

Tup is a file-based build system for Linux, OSX, and Windows. It takes
as input a list of file changes and a directed acyclic graph (DAG). It
then processes the DAG to execute the appropriate commands required to
update dependent files. Updates are performed with very little overhead
since tup implements powerful build algorithms to avoid doing
unnecessary work. This means you can stay focused on your project rather
than on your build system.

# See if we can remove the generated header and the filename from the rule at
# the same time. This should work because the generated header will be marked
# deleted, so we shouldn't have to worry about it in the rule. (Of course if it
# was still included in the C file the compiler would whine about it since we
# have to run the command again anyway).

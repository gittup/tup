# Output to a file in another directory, then blow away the directory that
# contained the rule. In this case, instead of re-parsing, we go through a
# recurse tup_del_id_type call which forces the directory and command nodes to
# go away. But since it wasn't reparsing, the directory sat around as a ghost,
# and then generated node still existed.

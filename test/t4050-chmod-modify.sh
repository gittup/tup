# The stat.st_ctime field is the file creation time in Windows, so we use
# st_mtime instead. However, st_mtime isn't modified when permissions are
# changed. We should be able to get this information from FILE_BASIC_INFORMATION (
# http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff545762%28v=vs.85%29.aspx
# ), but I don't know how to actually call a function to retrieve it.

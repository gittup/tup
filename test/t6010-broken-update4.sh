# Yet another broken update test, probably introduced from the last two. So now
# if we generate a few commands from a Tupfile (they're all modify), and the
# first one fails, so we change the Tupfile to create all new commands, the old
# ones are marked delete *and* modify, and they don't actually get removed.
# They should still be deleted.

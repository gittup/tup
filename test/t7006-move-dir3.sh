# This was an error case I discovered when I tried to move sysvinit out of
# gittup and compile everything. For some reason a directory gets marked as
# both create and delete, but the updater still tries to open the directory and
# update it. Basically we just set up some directories (so things are in
# create), then move it to another directory (so it goes in delete).

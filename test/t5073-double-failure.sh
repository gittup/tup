# Make sure we get useful error messages if we are missing dependencies and the
# command fails. The command could be failing because the missing input
# dependency was incorrect, and fixing that file may not result in a proper
# error message because it won't be updated before the failed command.
#
# Below, we forget to add libfoo.a as an input. Also, libfoo.a is missing the
# definition for bar(). The compile fails because bar() is missing. If we then
# add bar() to libfoo.a, the compilation for prog may happen before libfoo.a
# because the input dependencies were never checked. In this case we will
# continue to see the error message that bar is undefined, because libfoo.a
# is not updated in time. This is confusing because you don't know that the
# real error is that libfoo.a is not specified as an input.

# If a directory doesn't exist and we create a file there, the LD_PRELOAD
# server fails to find the tupid of the parent directory of the file, which
# triggered a different error condition in update_write_info() that didn't
# delete the errant file. This is different in the FUSE server because of the
# directory file mapping which prevents the directory from being created in the
# first place. We should remove the errant file regardless of whether the
# directory was present beforehand or not, otherwise we run the risk of being
# unable to declare it as an output without removing it manually.

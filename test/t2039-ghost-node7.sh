# Make sure ghost nodes in subdirectories work. I had a small bug where I was
# selecting against (dt, name) and if that failed insertting into (newdt, name).
# I ended up with a bunch of duplicate nodes. Here I check for that by making
# two scripts dependent on the same ghost node, then creating the ghost. Both
# scripts should update.

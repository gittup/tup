# When we finish processing a command, we add all destination links to the
# modify list so we can pick up where we left off if we failed. However, we
# need to make sure we don't do this with groups. We test this by setting up a
# scenario where <group> would end up in the modify list, and then remove the
# group. Since group removal just goes directly to delete_node(), this would
# leave the group in the modify list.

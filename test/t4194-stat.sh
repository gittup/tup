# Make sure stat() creates a dependency, whether or not it returns ENOENT. It
# seems we never had an explicit test for this. The original LD_PRELOAD
# implementation only counted stat() calls that returned ENOENT, and assumed
# that if it returned success, the program would then open() the file and we
# would count the open() instead. However, clang may call stat() on a directory
# passed in via -I, and if it is a normal file, it will not look for include
# files there. This matters for cases where the -I path is also a generated
# file, which should always be an error, regardless of whether or not the file
# already exists.

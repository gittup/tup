# For this bug, we have to create some command objects to be deleted. We need
# to successfully compile one file (bar.c). Then we change the commands, so the
# old ones are scheduled for deletion. The next update compiles bar.c again,
# but fails because foo.c is incorrect. This causes us to still have the old
# commands marked as deleted, but they haven't happened yet because we stopped
# on foo.c. Then foo.c is modified to be correct, and another update runs. Now
# the new (correct) command for bar.c is not in the partial DAG, but the old
# command to be deleted is. This causes bar.o to be incorrectly deleted on the
# third update
#
# I had to add a fake dependency from bar.o to the foo command because a random
# re-ordering of commands could make this test fail (ie: if foo happens to
# compile first).

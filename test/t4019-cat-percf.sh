# I used to do a weird thing where I'd append characters after a %f before the
# next space after each filename. So here, "cat %f;" would become "cat foo.txt;
# bar.txt;". I think this was so I could do "ld %F.o" when I didn't have the
# object files in the DAG (ie: this was a long time ago). I don't think it's
# necessary anymore and is confusing.

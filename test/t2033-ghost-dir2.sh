# Slightly more complex ghost dir - see if we have a ghost node (ghost) with a
# dir pointing to another ghost node (secret). Then we make secret a file, and
# then we remove secret and make it a directory, and then create ghost in it.
# Make sure that we don't lose ghost dependencies and that all works somehow.

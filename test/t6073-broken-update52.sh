# Make a directory that is used in a rule, then remove the directory and
# replace it with a symlink. This failed because the ghost dir2 would be placed
# into the create_list, then the new dir2 file created over top would still be
# in the create list. Since the top-level directory has a dependency on dir2,
# it would try to parse it in parse_dependent_tupfiles(), which bypassed the
# TUP_NODE_DIR check from create_work().

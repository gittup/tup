# Make sure we work with 'sed -i', which has an unusual temporary file creation
# characteristic - it creates a file with mode 000 so it can't be opened by
# other processes (I guess?). In fuse, if create() is not implemented, it
# mimics it by doing mknod() and then open(). Unfortunately, if the mknod()
# uses mode 000, then the open() fails. Therefore, tup needs to implement
# create() so this can be done in a single call.

# The foo.txt.tmp file is created and then renamed with NtSetInformationFile.
# Trying to hook this currently crashes tup - not sure why.
check_no_windows TODO: Fix NtSetInformationFile hook

# Note we need to explicitly give an extension (-i.tmp) since OSX will create
# a file called 'foo.txt-e' even though it says it won't in the man page.

# Output to a file in the root directory with a group, then move the directory.
# This causes the directory to be seen as deleted during the scan, so the
# command is immediately deleted. However, the output is not deleted because it
# exists in the root directory. When the new command is created and picks up
# the output, it tries to create the same group link and fails. Instead we
# should detect that it has an old group and prevent the double insertion.

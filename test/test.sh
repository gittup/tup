# Use as:
# To run a single test: ./test.sh t0000-init.sh
# To run all tests: ./test.sh
# To run all tests without stopping on errors: ./test.sh --keep-going
#
# You can also invoke a test case directly (as in: ./t0000-init.sh), but if it
# fails you may not always get an error message. You can still tell if the test
# failed by checking the return code (non-zero), and the tuptesttmp directory
# for that test will remain for manual inspection.

# While looking through the code, I noticed that there was no longer anything
# that actually tested a ghost being in a ghost directory (since fuse doesn't
# try to read from 'secret/ghost' like the ldpreload method did - it just
# stops at 'secret/'). Also it seems that instead of converting a directory
# with a ghost into a ghost itself, it was forcefully removing the child node,
# so dependencies would then be missing. This verifies that behavior.

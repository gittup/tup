# This tries to do an fopen inside a constructor of a shared library linked
# into the main executable. Apparently this is what libselinux.so.1 does on
# the Ubuntu machine I'm using to test 64-bit, and it's linked into a bunch
# of utilities like cp and mv. This breaks because apparently my constructor
# in ldpreload isn't called until after all shared libraries are loaded.

# This checks for a specific bug where a command would get marked deleted, then
# a new command would try to write to that node and succeed, then the deleted
# command would be re-created and also succeed. The end result is two commands
# trying to write to the same output file, with no error report from tup.

cat > Tupfile << HERE

HERE
tup touch Tupfile
update
tup_dep_exist . 'echo hey > foo' . foo
tup_object_no_exist . 'echo yo > foo'

# Now we make a new command before the first - this should fail to parse,
# resulting in no change to the links.

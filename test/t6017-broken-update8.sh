# For some reason switching from 'gcj -C %f' to 'gcj -c %f' ends up not
# creating a link from B.java to the command for A.o, when class A uses B.
# Turns out this is because the second time around, compiling A.java reads
# from B.class instead of B.java. Then B.class is deleted (because the command
# to create it is gone, and we're creating .o files now) so the dependency is
# gone. I solved this by moving the file deletions out into its own phase.
#
# This test case merely mimics this process because when I upgraded to gcc
# 4.3.2 from 4.1.something, gcj became slow as crap. The 'ls | grep' part is
# to mimic the getdents() syscall that javac and gcj appear to use.

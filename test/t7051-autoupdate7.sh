# If a sub-process fails, the monitor sees that as a file deletion event
# and tries to remove the node. This shouldn't trigger the logic that
# determines if files have changed in handle_events, since the updater
# has already done all the necessary legwork. Here we check to make sure
# that the autoupdate runs only once if the command fails, and doesn't
# try to re-trigger itself (which would cause it to run a second time).

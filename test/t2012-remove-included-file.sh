# Include a separate Tupfile, then stop including it and make sure the link to
# the directory goes away. I put everything in a tmp directory because
# tup_dep_exist doesn't work using '. .' (since I need to use 0 as the parent
# for '.' and I don't feel like fixing it...and I realized all these ''s and
# .'s look like faces.)
#
# Actually I fixed it so you can use the string "0" to represent the parent of
# the '.' directory (I figure since the tup_dep_exist thing is only used by
# test-cases, so I just won't generate a file called "0" and it will be fine -
# it doesn't impact users with 0 files), but I'm leaving this test the way it
# is because the faces are silly.
